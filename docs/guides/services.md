# Services

STT, LLM and TTS providers are all processors behind small interfaces. Swapping
one is a one-line change, because nothing in the pipeline depends on which
provider you picked.

## The pattern

Every provider is a `Config` struct plus a constructor:

```go
stt := deepgram.NewSTT(deepgram.Config{APIKey: key})
llm := anthropic.NewLLM(anthropic.Config{APIKey: key, Model: "claude-sonnet-5"})
tts := cartesia.NewTTS(cartesia.Config{APIKey: key, VoiceID: id})
```

Library packages read **no environment variables** and take no functional options.
Configs are validated with `go-playground/validator` tags, so a bad config fails
at construction rather than mid-call. Reading env vars, flags or config files is
your app's job. See `examples/`.

Most fields have sensible defaults: an empty `Model` picks the provider's
recommended one, and `SampleRate: 0` inherits the transport's rate.

> **The config type name varies by provider.** A provider that offers one service
> names it plainly `Config`; one that offers several qualifies the extras. So it
> is `deepgram.Config` for STT but `deepgram.TTSConfig` for TTS, `cartesia.Config`
> for TTS but `cartesia.STTConfig` for STT, and `openai.STTConfig` /
> `openai.LLMConfig` / `openai.TTSConfig` for all three. Check the package, or
> let the compiler tell you.

## Providers

Pick any per category.

| Category | Providers |
|---|---|
| **STT** | Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Gladia, Speechmatics, Soniox, Whisper (OpenAI/Groq/local), Azure |
| **LLM** | Anthropic (direct + Bedrock), OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Together, Fireworks, DeepSeek, Cerebras, Perplexity, OpenRouter, xAI, Ollama, NVIDIA, Mistral, Nebius, SambaNova, Qwen, Azure OpenAI |
| **TTS** | ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Rime, LMNT, Kokoro, Piper, Deepgram, OpenAI, Azure, Hume, Fish, MiniMax |
| **Speech-to-speech** | OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live, AWS Nova Sonic |
| **Memory** | mem0 |

Each lives in `provider/<name>`, and there are more in the tree than listed above.
Browse [`provider/`](../../provider) for the current set. Per-provider runnable
examples are in [`examples/voice/`](../../examples/voice).

Coverage is uneven: the providers used by the examples get the most exercise, and
some of the others are thinly tested. Bug reports naming a specific provider are
especially useful.

## The interfaces

You rarely implement these, but knowing their shape explains what a provider can
and cannot do.

### STT

Two flavors. **Streaming** is what you want for conversation:

```go
type Connector interface {
    Connect(ctx context.Context, sampleRate int) (Stream, error)
}

type Stream interface {
    Send(audio []byte) error
    Recv() ([]Result, error)
    Close() error
}
```

`stt.StreamService` wraps a `Connector` into a processor: audio in, interim and
final `TranscriptionFrame`s out.

**Segment** STT transcribes a finished buffer instead, for providers with no
streaming API:

```go
type Transcriber interface {
    Transcribe(ctx context.Context, audio []byte, sampleRate int) (string, error)
}
```

Segment STT emits no interim transcriptions. It still works with
`WithTurnTaking()`, which gates on a *finalized* transcript, but start strategies
that key on partial transcripts never fire, so turn starts fall back to VAD alone.
`openai.NewSTT` is segment-based; `deepgram.NewSTT` streams.

### LLM

```go
type Generator interface {
    Generate(ctx context.Context, convo *frames.LLMContext, emit Emit) error
}
```

Stream deltas to `emit` until done or `ctx` is canceled. **Cancellation is an
interruption**: honor it, or barge-in stalls for up to three seconds.

Tool-capable providers implement `ToolGenerator` as well:

```go
type ToolGenerator interface {
    GenerateWithTools(ctx context.Context, convo *frames.LLMContext, sink Sink) error
}
```

`llm.Base` runs the tool loop automatically when the context carries tools and the
generator supports them.

### TTS

```go
type Synthesizer interface {
    SampleRate() int
    Synthesize(ctx context.Context, text string, emit func(pcm []byte) error) error
}
```

Providers that return word timings also implement `WordTimestamps`, which is what
lets `TTSTextFrame`s align to the audio actually being spoken, and therefore what
lets an interrupted response be recorded truncated rather than whole.

## Tool calling

Register a handler by name, then advertise the tool on the context:

```go
llm.RegisterFunction("get_order_status", func(ctx context.Context, args json.RawMessage) (string, error) {
    var in struct{ OrderID string `json:"order_id"` }
    if err := json.Unmarshal(args, &in); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return lookup(ctx, in.OrderID)
})

convo.SetTools([]frames.Tool{{
    Name:        "get_order_status",
    Description: "Look up the status of an order by its ID.",
    Parameters:  json.RawMessage(`{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}},
        "required": ["order_id"]
    }`),
}})
```

`Parameters` is a raw JSON-Schema object. A handler that blocks **must honor
`ctx`**, the same interruption rule as `Generate`.

Tool results reach the context on an uninterruptible frame, so a tool that has
already run is never lost to a barge-in. See
[LLM context](../concepts/llm-context.md#tool-calls).

## Speech-to-speech

A single model replaces the STT → LLM → TTS trio:

```go
s2s := openairealtime.New(openairealtime.Config{APIKey: key})

pipeline.New(t.Input(), s2s, t.Output())
```

The three implementations are `provider/openairealtime`, `provider/geminilive`
and `provider/novasonic`.

Lower latency and better prosody, at the cost of the per-stage control you get
from three separate services. You cannot inspect the transcript before the model
answers, or swap just the voice.

## Switching at runtime

`pipeline.NewServiceSwitcher` routes to one of several services, changed mid-call
by pushing a `SwitchServiceFrame`:

```go
sw, err := pipeline.NewServiceSwitcher(
    []processor.Processor{fastLLM, smartLLM},
    pipeline.SwitchManual,   // or pipeline.SwitchFailover
)
...
task.QueueFrame(pipeline.NewSwitchServiceFrame(smartLLM))
```

`SwitchFailover` additionally moves to the next service when the active one
reports a non-fatal error, which is the cheap way to survive a provider outage.

Useful for escalating to a stronger model when a conversation gets hard, without
rebuilding the pipeline.
