// no sentence, and splitting it would hand the synthesizer half a tag. Once a
// start tag is seen the aggregator keeps accumulating unconditionally until the
// matching end tag arrives, whatever punctuation it passes on the way.

// The tags themselves are pass-through markers. They are not removed, because
// the synthesizer is what interprets them.
