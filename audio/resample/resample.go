// Package resample converts interleaved S16LE PCM audio between sample rates,
// preserving the channel count. It reconciles service sample rates (for example
// 24 kHz TTS audio) with the 48 kHz the WebRTC/Opus output path needs.
//
// There are two ways to convert, and which one is right depends on whether the
// audio keeps coming:
//
//   - A Resampler is for a stream. It is stateful, carrying filter state across
//     calls so a continuous stream converts cleanly across chunk boundaries, and
//     it holds back the filter delay at the end of every call because more audio
//     is expected. Create one per stream with New; it is not safe for concurrent
//     use, and Close must be called when finished.
//   - Resample is for a buffer that is complete on its own: a sound effect, a
//     recorded utterance, one turn of audio handed to a model. It converts in a
//     single pass and flushes the filter delay, so nothing is clipped off the
//     end. Running a complete buffer through a Resampler instead loses a
//     millisecond or two of its tail.
//
// Two builds are selected by the `libsoxr` build tag, both exposing the same
// API:
//
//   - Default (pure Go, see resample_purego.go): a no-cgo converter from
//     github.com/gojargo/go-resample. It cross-compiles and links into static
//     binaries with no native dependency.
//   - `-tags libsoxr` (see resample_soxr.go): links libsoxr (the SoX Resampler)
//     via cgo for its high-quality polyphase conversion. Requires libsoxr at
//     build and run time (libsoxr-dev to build, libsoxr0 to run).
package resample

// Resample converts a complete buffer of interleaved S16LE PCM from inRate to
// outRate at the default quality, in a single pass. Unlike Resampler.Process it
// flushes the converter's filter delay, so the returned audio holds the whole
// signal rather than stopping a filter length short of it. Use it for audio that
// arrives whole; use a Resampler for audio that keeps coming.
//
// It returns the input unchanged when the rates match, and nil for an empty
// buffer.
